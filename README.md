Welcome to the One Piece Memory Game! This is a web-based memory game built using React, utilizing the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks. The game features a theme inspired by the popular anime and manga series, One Piece.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards. There are a total of 12 cards, with 6 unique card designs. All cards are initially turned upside down. Your goal is to flip two cards at a time and find matching pairs.

- Click on a card to reveal its image.
- Click on another card to reveal its image.
- If the two cards match, they will remain face up.
- If the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back face down.
- Keep flipping cards and matching pairs until all cards are successfully matched.

In the bottom section of the game, you will find a turn counter. Each turn is counted in a currency called "berries." The turn counter will update with the number of turns you have taken to complete the game.
